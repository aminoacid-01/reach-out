## Features 



### Existing Features

- __Navigation Bar__

  - Featured on all three pages, the full responsive navigation bar includes links to the Logo, Home page, About section, Mental Health Tips section, Resources & helplines page and Contact page and is identical in each page to allow for easy navigation.
  - This section will allow the user to easily navigate from page to page across all devices without having to revert back to the previous page via the ‘back’ button. 


- __Hero Image__

  - The header contains a hero image with the project name and tagline overlayed on top with text shadow for decoration and readablilty.

- __Mental Health Tips Section__

  - This section contains general tips and advise on how to manage the symptoms of depression, anxiety and stress. I chose these because they're common and most people will experience at least some symptoms of these conditions at some point in their life.


- __Helplines Section__

  - This section provides the user with some helplines that they could call or text to get help if they need it in that moment.

  - The footer section includes links to social media such as facebook, instagram and twitter (now known as X).
  - It also has the copyright.


### Features Left to Implement

- More tips for a variety of symptoms and mental health problems.
- More helplines and orgs.
- Links to support groups.

## Accesiblity

- All of the images used throughout this project have alt-titles 
- I ensured that all foreground and background colours had good contrast. For example:
![contrast-checker](./assets/docs/contrast.jpg)
- I noticed that the text was a bit too small on desktop so I increased the font-size via a media query to increase readability on larger screens.
- As aformentioned, I added a text-shadow for further readability on the text overlaying the hero image.

## Testing 




### Validator Testing 
I consistantly tested the validity of my html throughout the process of writing it to ensure I wasn't blindsided by lots of confusing errors on the last day.
- HTML
  - No errors were returned when passing through the official W3C markup validator. 
  - [index.html](./assets/docs/valid-index.jpg)
  - [resources.html](./assets/docs/valid-resources.jpg)
  - [contact.html](./assets/docs/valid-contact.jpg)
- CSS
  - No errors were found when passing through the official W3C CSS validator.

  -[desktop](./assets/docs/lighthouse-desktop-index.jpg)
- Helplines & Resources Page

### Manual Testing 

I also manual testing of all of the links, ensuring that all of the internal and external links work. 
In my testing, I found out that there was problems with the link in the navbar to the homepage. On further investigation and troubleshooting, I realised that I had accidentally linked to the wrong page. I fixed that promptly.


## Deployment

I deployed the project via github pages at the end of the first day. 
I went to the settings of the repo, clicked on pages on the side bar, selected deploy from branch and then selected the main branch.
