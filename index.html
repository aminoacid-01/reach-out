                                    may be tempting to withdraw from your loved ones and isolate yourself, it will only

                                    you feel worse. It's helpful to have a support network and people to talk to about
                                    how
                                    you are feeling. </li>

                                    start with walking for 20 minutes everyday</li>

                                    to get into poor eating and sleeping habits. Try to get up at your
                                    normal time, remember to eat regularly and stick to a routine!</li>

                                    can do on your own without professional help, and that's fine! Don't be afraid to
                                    get professional help if your symptoms continue or worsen.

                                good. Slowly working towards being able to face situations that typically make you

                                <li><i class="fa-regular fa-heart"></i> <strong>Accept things you can’t change -</strong> Many things that stress us out are things that are out of our control. Try to
